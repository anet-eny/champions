# We are the Champions

We are the Champions is a simple web application where users can share their endorsements or messages. Inspired by the iconic song, this project allows users to publish their thoughts and see them displayed in a list format. This project was developed as part of the Scrimba curriculum.

## Features

- Endorsement Submission: Users can write their endorsements in a text area and publish them by clicking the "Publish" button.
- Endorsement Display: Published endorsements are displayed in a list below the input area.
- Firebase Integration: Utilizes Firebase Realtime Database to store and retrieve endorsements in real-time.

## Key Learnings

- **Firebase Integration:** Learned how to integrate Firebase Realtime Database into a web application to enable real-time data storage and retrieval.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Practiced manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript to dynamically update the content of the web page based on user interactions.
- **Event Handling:** Implemented event listeners to respond to user actions, such as button clicks, and trigger corresponding functions.
